# Minecraft Rendering

I wrote this code while reading the book _Learn OpenGL Graphics Programming_ (https://learnopengl.com/book/book_pdf.pdf) and following the OpenGL tutorials on The Cherno's YouTube channel in order to familiarize myself with graphics programming concepts.

Then, I adapted the code to render a Mincraft scene.

### The project includes:

- Management of Vertex Buffer Array
- Index rendering
- Textures
- WASD and mouse for moving and looking around

### To be implemented:

- Lighting
- Shadows

### Screenshot:

Once compiled, the project looks like this:

The IMGUI interface applies transformations to the cube.
